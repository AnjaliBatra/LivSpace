Very happy with the designing aspect. The site execution team need to be a bit more flexible and approachable. Overall happy with the service and outcome. Product us user friendly and very good quality hardwares used. Happy with the experience and will definitely recommend to others
"My experience with Livspace has been excellent. We got our Kitchen in a 2BHK in Brigade Cosmopolis done by them. The designer, Sonia, established a good working understanding & regular communication inspite of us being based outside India. We visited the Experience Center only once while signing up with Livspace and post that, multiple video & audio calls were made to discuss every detail of the 2D as well as 3D and was handled with utmost responsibility and patience.

Post the initial design phase, the execution was handled by Project manager, Meer Ameenuddin, who kept us on track with weekly progress reports and even catered to the finer details to give us the best quality finishes.

Despite this being a tight budget project, the costs were managed well and the cherry on the cake was handing us the completed project in lesser than the tentative quotation we signed up for."
"For My independent house at Horamavu , the interior has been done by Livspace.

We are very happy with the services provided. Good design , timely completion by the team.

The project Manager Mr.Harsha has taken care of smallest problems without any hesitations and has great level of patience.

Highly recommended livspace if you’re are doing up your house."
I recommend livspace for their good service. Good coordination between the designing and project management team. Their delivery of service was on time. The best part about them was even the minute problems were fixed on time even after delivery of services.
"The new team with Sahil Siddiqui and Shailesh that was assigned to our project to complete pending works and snags has done a good job and completed the snags diligently. They have promised to do some of left over jobs as well in due course, which we are sure they will. Thanks"
"We are at 50% stage right now, So far the experience have been good with Livspace.

In fact we were able to decide and close the design in almost single sitting.

Kudos to Poorva ...rockstar!!! Hope we get the completion as perceived by her as is without any change in her creativity as we have liked it at one go.

Thanks to the 2D design lady as well as she too have been very swift in finishing the drawings.

Hope our project turns out to be practical and one of your good work worth mentioning"
"Excellent work by team Livspace!!! They did an awesome job with our new flat in the exact time that they had promised.Thank you designer shrishti for bringing our thoughts to life, not to forget project manager Aarti for making sure that everything went perfect and Sahil sidddiqui( project executive) for making sure that the smallest problems were taken care of without any fuss. Highly recommend livspace if you’re doing up your house!!"
"Our experience with Livspace was just wow.....Whole team is very professional, accommodating ; customer centric....faced some issues but overall we are Very happy with their services and modular stuff... Hope their after sevice would be equally good."
"Great work. Everyone working here knows what's best. They've helped get the right kitchen by considering everything we asked them for. They've delivered what they promised us. Great team of experts. Neha rathod, the designer;shifali singh, the manager and Harsha, the project manager has done a great job!"
"I recently moved to Gurgaon, at DLF Park Place, in a new apartment. While the apartment had all cupboards and modular kitchen, it needed lot of civil work and interiors. And of course a lot of furniture. Most of all, I needed some good inputs in terms of the design/decor/furnishings, and someone who can play the referee between my wife and I, and get us both to agree on different things. Given my extensive travel, I didn't have enough time to invest in managing these different tasks. A colleague suggested Livspace and I signed them up.

The experience with the Livspace team has been quite good. They delivered on all the aspects, in a professional manner. The CRM Shruti, and the Project Manager Arti were highly responsive and provided very useful inputs and recommendations. We are very happy with most of the work done through Livspace, and the furniture we ordered from them. The only issue we had was the civil work; that vendor selected by Livspace could have been better.

A special word of appreciation for their Lead Electrician Sahil. My heart was set onto a video doorbell (I have two grown up daughters and wanted an extra layer of security) from the US - Skybell HD. I got it delivered from the US as they don't sell in India. I thought I had figured it all out and the installation would be a breeze like they advertised. But to my pleasant surprise, Sahil did extensive research and looked up several You Tube videos to understand what it will take to get Skybell started. He was at it for 3-4 weeks and assured me that he will get it going. And voila, it did! Had I got it done the way I had envisaged, it would have blown - mainly due to the current type and the voltage level we have in India, for which Skybell is not designed. Sahil showed the rare dedication and commitment that we do not normally come across in these matters. His workmanship and knowledge is also unparalleled.

Thank you Livspace!"
"I am no expert. But this seems like a big scam. Every one seems to be so happy and satisfied. Though I saw reviews on other sites as well and people did had bad experience. Please be aware I don't have any personal experience with livspace. And seeing this, very much concerned about booking them"
"We are very happy with the services provided by LivSpace. We used their design services, construction servicesand also bought furniture from them. Especialy, we are glad that Sahil, Aarti amd Richika were involved with our project. We will use LivSpace services soon."
The team of Arti and Feroz did a great job of executing and managing a team of vendors to execute the design project for my home at M3M Golf Estate. The team was responsive and coordinated well with multiple vendors to deliver the project. Great job. Highly recommend Livspace.
"Livspace team did an awesome job in my flat in Pioneer Presidia. The entire team was very effective and cooperative.

The designer Urvija was very creative and patient, and helped alot even after the flat handover. The project manger Arti also executed the project as per expectations . Akhilesh and Umesh from civil work project team also did a good job."
"I had a great experience with Livspace. Palak Jolly, a Livspace representative attended me to understand and design a beautiful and simple modular Kitchen, wardrobe and Temple. She always suggested better color combinations and designs which is what makes me satisfied with them mostly. Would like to recommend and use their products & services again:)"
"It looks Fab mainly because ofthe following people :

1> Jitendra our Interior Designer who went beyond his reach to help in designing our new home ie False Ceiling, Wardrobes, Modular kitchen and interior decor. It was indeed a roller coaster ride which we all enjoyed and would definitely recommend him for future projects.

2>Pavan the project manager who ensured smooth project delivery from shipment to assembling to complete handover. Also specific mention on thecore cutting for chimney which was done as per our special requirement even although it was against all odds. (Livesaver indeed)

3>Kiran the ever smiling gentleman who ensured the key deliverables were met and also helped us in setting up our kitchen and wardrobes. (Kiran kindly pass on our appreciation to your carpenter's for a commendable job).

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed designing our home with livespace and would definitely recommend them to others mainly due to their quality products and customer specific approach.

Thank you Livespace"
"Will never recommend Livspace for home interiors. Very bad company to work with – unprofessional, irresponsible and unaccountable starting from designer to company head. More than 4 months after payment – work yet to be completed. Work is shoddy. Final product different from the designed one. No co-ordination – at design manufacture and installation levels. Signing up with Livspace is a trap – you have no way out. Believe this or else you can suffer.

They just don't respond to calls or e-mails. Customer care is also a sham. In fact if you call in the customer care number the answer is ""this number is temporarily withdrawn"". Escalation to higher officials just doesn't work - they just look hapless. They are all new passouts with little administrative experience. You will feel helpless and frustrated and with no help in sight curse your own fate. That's my state now."
"My experience with Livspace is amazing. Especially, Project Manager ""Ajay S"" is a wonderful guy. Right from day one he took care of the project personally and delivered qualitative output. Not only the execution, he foresees certain nuances and takes care of those things and the best part is he will explain and make you understand about them.

He is always a call away and responds to you with utmost patience. Given a chance, I would like to have him as Project Manager for my next project too. And it's good to see Livspace has such quality employees.

We are totally in love with our interiors just because of the superb execution by Ajay and great quality interiors provided from Livspace.

Also, I would like to thank Subramanya J.A who is part of Ajay's team. He is always reachable, super helpful and made sure that project got completed smoothly."
"I am writing this review as a humble note of appreciation for the wonderful attitude, helpful approach and attentiveness to service demonstrated by Deepthi(Desinger), Amit & Rajshekar from Project team who stood until the last day of my project. You guys were able to think from my perspective after the first escaltion which was made on behalf of finance issue and then onwards I could sense that you had passion in helping your customers. Your dedication and attentiveness made me tention free in completing the work much before my house warming date. I sincerely appreciate and am extremely grateful for the work, time and effort put into making sure my request for earlier completion of project. Will get in touch shortly so that we can finish the final allignment of the kithcen. Thanks again to the entire Team of Livspace for providing outstanding customer service.

Probably I would have given one more star if I had an option. Once again great work by all 3 in planning & executing.

On the other hand, I would also like to share my bad experience with one of the Business Manager(Ms. Kalyani) who really doesn't have any kind of email ethique to acknowledge an email when sent, even after couple of days. Also noticed that her main intention was to somehow make customer to make the initial 10% payment and book the project. Post which she never care or replied back to any of my concern on time. I request this behaviour has to rectfied when they are working with customers on daily basis."
"Just wanted to share feedback on specifics

Flexibility - from the very start we had a theme planned for each room. The vision we had and you sharing the same with the vendor has been immaculate and to the T. Right down the selecting “the yellow colour” or doing a moulding finish for our daughters room - The team helped us getting solutions for each. Even if vendor thought if was impossible.

The teamwork - livspace, the vendor and the project incharge, have worked like a symphony. We managed to meet everything on time and at each step we were given status which helped us planning our movement. For a owner, who’s living on rent and paying EMI, this becomes very important. Delay punches financially.

Lastly, the quality - we had a situation where we had the entire wardrobe as modular but the vendor couldn’t do the bed modular. Thankfully, Lispace team, pushed the vendor for taking up the beds as well and now we have exact same finish in all our furniture. These small-small things that matter. Having modular furniture in ply and not MDF another thing we didn’t even know and just changed our perception.

Overall. Very good experience and well managed"
"I heard a lot about livepace and thought of doing my interior from them .After going to livepace office I spoke with Kalyani who is the manager and Sonika who was my interior designer .They both were very polite and I also get convinced to take from livespace .I selected my kitchen color and wardrobes color their itself.Soon after that the process started and they told me min 2 months will take to deliver the product. PM was Mukesh and he came to take all the necessary measurements .After 2 months the setup of my home was done very neatly and they always clean the area where they worked .In 2 days all setup was done .I really appreciate their efforts and time .

Will surely suggest Livepace to others as well"
"I have used the service of live space and the project Manager Anjo John took care of all the works related to installation, shifting of electrical and plumbing points and all other vendor related works seamlessly. Throughout the execution I handed over the keys to him used to visit only over weekend and every thing is taken care. He goes the extra mile to make the customer happy. Great Job Anjo.

The materials are also good. Only negative is the designs."
"I got to know of livspace even before I got possession of my home as they were following up with me for designing our home. I had not planned getting my home done through them but after I saw their presentation I totally changed my mind. I had initially though of getting my house done through the local contractors.

I along with the designer kept making changes till it was to my satisfaction & liking. The home should be cosy & inviting so that you feel relaxed after a tiring day at work.

The team is very professional & organized due to which at times the project takes longer than expected to get completed. Neeraja & Harsh have been my point of contact & have always taken up calls & guided me whenever I have approached them. Harsh is supremely talented & has been able to complete my project before the time line.

On the whole the experience was wonderful. During this tenure I made some good friends. Hoping to continue being connected.

Keep up the good work."
"We had got our interiors done by Livspace. Due to many problems the completion of work took very long time. Due to thedelay there wasa change of project manager and Mr Amit took over as the new PM for our project. We could see a significantchange in theapproach and speed in the execution of work.

He was very proactive, entreprenuerial, and passionate about the work.His approach made us forget the delays. He is a great asset to Livspace -thanks to Mr.Amit and his team."
"I got my kitchen done from Livspace, the product was delivered in time. The execution team was excellent. Mr. Kiran took care of execution very effectively and in timely manner. There are several teams working in parallel, Granite Installation, Kitchen Installation and Tiles. The entire work was carried out in very smooth and efficient manner. Mr. Kiran and Pavan were very friendly and was always there to address our concerns or queries and resolve any issues."
"I am glad to write this review because of the wonderful experience I had working with Livspace Bangalore. We approached Livspace when we were half way through with our construction, and Vardhini was assigned as a designer for our project. we were asked to visit the display centre in Bangalore which clearly showcase their products and designs. we went with a prepoccupied designs in our mind and The kind of ideas and designs they peresented were too good to ignore, and just had to go with it. Vardhini is so knowledgeable on the products and giving valuable advice at each stage with great designs.She was following up on the status of the project every moment and answering every questions till the end of the project(exhibiting true professionalism). Amazing job Vardhini, Keep up the excellent work! Thanks for making my home look so beautiful.

I also had an opportunity to work with project executive Madhusudhan and project manager Ashwin from Livspace Bangalore. Madhu used to be very proactive during the project execution. He used to coordinate with all department people, be it, Plumbing, electric, carpentry, tiling etc, made them be on the site at the same time and complete the job.Madhu was very enthusiastic and energetic with his work. Keep up the good work Madhu!.

There was a time where the kitchen slab alignment was not proper and needed to be repaired, Ashwin and madhu worked on this and got it repaired(although it wasnt easy).Thanks Ashwin for making some of the key decisions during execution of the project. Keep up the good work!

I also take this opportunity to thank each and every member of your team involved in this project.You people have done an amazing job.

I am so glad to have selected Livspace for my home interiors.

You can just give them the project and need not have to worry, they will take care of it with a very good quality."
We got our interiors done by Livspace and few of the custom products we accepted while handover of the project had issues which were recurring even after repair work . We contacted After sales team ..they were very prompt and efficient. Pratham from after sales team came for review and provided end to end solution. He worked very hard and replaced our products without any hassle and the new products given to us are of very good quality. There was no rework or repair work done at site...the products were delivered and installed with very much ease and diligent supervision of Mr. Pratham Vishnoi.
"My interiors were all done by Livspace and recently some issues came up in wardrobe and kitchen work. Raised the complaint on care@livspace and got it resolved in a couple of days. The Livspace guys were very professional and have always been very polite and understanding the concerns raised. Overall, good experience and looking forward to some more work from Livspace."
My wardrobe shutter came down on 14Feb. I was trying to contact livspace on email but the mailbox is full and nd not accepting new mails. Called all the associated livspace people. My designer also put forward my mail but their was no reponse. Finally I called Shuchi and got the customer care number. From there onwards it was a quick service. The complaint was filed yesterday and the workers arrived today with prompt service and resolved by Ujjwal and team. thanks a lot
"We had a positive experience from the team comprising of Srushti Angolkar(Interior Designer), Prashanth Rao(Project Manager) and Aslam Basha(Project Executive) at Livspace Bangalore. They did the interiors for our 4BHK 2400 sq feet apartment.

Srushti took all our likes into account and incorporated these into the final design. Generally she guided us in the right direction. Srushti did not hesitate to say no to some of our ideas when it was required.

Prashanth was very reliable and responsible and was always available whenever we needed to troubleshoot. Aslam remained accessible and patient throughout the installation period and even beyond. He came across as a very hardworking and dedicated person.

Overall we had a pleasant and rewarding experience with Livspace. One thing we have noted is that this entire process(especially for a big sized apartment for end-user) takes time. If you are not in a hurry, the end product from Livspace will not disappoint you."
I was hesitant when I approached Livspace. I thought it will be costly. Just responded to a call and when mentioned by requirements was surprised to hear the quote being so affordable. I met Gautam Gupta from design team and shared my requirements and budget at hand. He rest assured that designs can be affordable. When he came up with the design for my terrace it looked like a dream. And when it’s implemented too I can’t believe how good it looks. It’s become a daily routine for us to just to have coffee admiring terrace. Thanks to Gautam. Great design and fast implementation
"The design process was very elaborate. That also took time (4 months) thoughthe designer showed lot of patience. It was a good experience.

The delivery was very slow and frustrating. Took 5 weeks after payment to even kick off. Had to chase all the time and keep escalating.The supervisor on the ground Rakesh was very approachable. He would listen to us and many a times go out of the way to get things done for customer satisfaction.

It's took 5 months for handover and still the kitchen loft is not yet delivered."
"The interiors of my flat are almost done now. So it’s a good time to review.

LivSpace did a great job and were on time to deliver the project.

I would specifically like to mention the Project Managers- Aftaba and Karan; who religiously followed up with the labour and the vendor to get the job done. Aftab was there every single day to monitor the work and was on top of it. Karan was always responsive when we raised any concerns with the execution.

We were very happy with our designer- Charul. She has a very good sense of colour and materials. Her suggestions were in line with our thoughts and thus it was easy to work with her. She went out of her way to help in carefully picking the best elements to fit in with the concept we had in mind for each room. She was always available on phone for quick suggestions/recommendations.

Their Kitchen and Wardrobe expert- Mukendra is a smart guy and knows his job well. He was there at the site to guide the carpenters, whenever needed. He was very good at getting things done in the right way.

The seniors- Rida and Sreevinoth need a special mention for their in-person visits and unbiased opinions. They did put a good team together for us. Again, both of them were very responsive to all our concerns.

Like every project in life, this one had its ups and downs as well. There were days, we did feel that we made a mistake by slecting LivSpace. However the LivSpace team was always cooperative, heard our concerns with an open mind and resolved all of them effectively."
"It has been near to two years since I got my home interiors done at livspace.

Glad to have ordered interiors at livspace.

Though the cost at livspace seemed a bit on higher range, the quality and the sevice provided was excellent and ontime.

In simple words, I am much satisfied to be their part!!"
Got the channel replaced for the chest of draws from Livspace. Service was prompt and good. Within a week got the replacement after inspection. Thanks for the speedy resolution. Speedy resolution after sales service indicates they are committed to service
"Thanks Ujjawal for helping and fixing the leakage of kitchen and Support for all small workshop.

Livspace work is dedicated and at par .

All work done as given duration.

We can trust and believe the quality of work, politeness in person and deep understanding of work.

Looking forward a healthy work relationship."
The design process was elaborate and they made sure my design needs were met. After sales service has been good. It went a little over my budget though. But the goods delivered were upto my satisfaction. Advise : remember to note that design requirement may result in some civil work as well. Factor in those charges as well. Make sure you go through your specification with the project people before beginning work. keep a list of specifications you asked for .Interact more with the project guys before beginning work. Point to note for livespace. Consider electrical drawings of the project while designing.
"It was a great experience for us choosing Livspace as our interior designing company. They are dedicated team of professional who has converted our ideas to designs, design to reality. I am happy to get my interiors done within my budget and I see a great value for my money. The execution team Amit, Sameer and Rajshekhar was brilliant in completing the work on time without delays. I found the organizationwith good tractable system and process. A great thanks to entire team and Livspace for making our house a great place to live in.

I would definitely recommend LIvspace services to other.

We have done our kitchen from Liv Space.

I made the right decision by choosing Livspace for my Home interiors. Any company or designer can make Great interiors but the thing that matters is After sales.

Livspace has always lived up to my expectations with in time support and trouble free.

Great Job Team Livspace."

"We got our interior done by Livspace. We met few local designer and some reputed designers before choosing livespace but we chose to go with livspace because after seeing the layout of our flat, the idea of open kitchen with breakfast counter was given to us by the designer Chandana Erugu. None of the other reputed interior designer gave us this idea. She was very patient in her approach. She prepared some good presentation with ideas for our home. From onboarding, design, validations, execution and handover chandana's support was always there. She also helped us in selecting interior items both from livspace and outside market. She did a great job by providing 3d images of the wardrobes, made us experience it. We changed the design multiple time but she ensured to incorporate all patiently.

Overall the implementation was well planned only because of our designer. We will give full credit to her. Kudos Chandana!!"
I got my interior done through Livspace and they have done a great job. I would like to specially thank Prashant Rao and Asik for the great job with ensuring timely delivery and installation of the project. They have been very quick and always reachable whenever we wanted help from them. Special mention of Asik for all his efforts in getting the installations done quickly and following up with relevant folks to get the job done.
"Livespace (Aahana, Trupti, Naresh and team) did an amazing job of our house and delivered everything at the right quality and time. We got a great experience and were involved through the process. Their status reports and help with drawings and designs also really helped us think through things which was very helpful."
"Positive:

I got my home interior done by livspace. I met few local designer and some reputed designers before choosing livespace. When I met livspace they assigned Designer for our project for initial design and costing. They assigned Waheda - designer for my project. She got great patience, she showed livspace work. I liked the work done by livspace in other project. Waheda took care of each and every need for my home interior from all family member in multiple sittings. I changed the design multiple time she ensured to incorporate all. I though cost is exceeding my budget, Waheda give some cool ideas to ensure I get what I want but keep the budget as low as possible. She also helped us in selecting each and every interior items both from livspace and outside market.

Could have been better:

Only one item where livspace could have done better is when they contracted vendor for electric work.

Overall:

I am very happy with work done by livspace. I got the home interior done better than what I was thinking. I surely recommend livspace for home interior irrespective of your budget."
"I got interior works done for my newly built house through Livspace. Designer Praveen did a great job by providing 3d images of the wardrobes, made us experience it. Livspace has wide range of material finishes( membrane lacre glass acrylic finishes) , & accessories to choose for the wardrobes. In detail he explained us the different products it's pros & cons and also made sure that the best product Will fit in our budget. The wardrobes designs for 5 bedrooms & kitchen cabinets were approved by Neha Arora the design manager and sent to the production team. project manager Kartik babu made sure that the products were delivered and installed in our site much before the promised date. Finally the execution work done by kitchen wardrobe storage expert ( kws) Shasshi & his team of carpenters did excellent job. When all these products were installed we were dwelling in our house. Yet we dint feel any discomfort, all the wardrobes for 5 rooms were installed within a weeks time without creating any trouble to us. They gave attention to very minute details made sure everything was right. The alignments of the storage units were perfect.

Overall, The wardrobes were installed exactly the way it was in design & we are very satisfied by the work done by Livspace & team."
"Livspace did pretty good and cleanjob... on time delivery...timely execution and. professionallywork done...simple and elegant designs. . Thanks to the team Bhavna the designer, and the execution team Vikas, Sachin...very helpful guys.. All d best…"
"Entire experience with livspace was awesome, my designer was Vijaykumar H S, he was extremely professional and has been very patient and cooperative throughout the journey. For someone novice like me he was a great guide and helped make the right choices for house interiors even with minute details.Gnan who was the PM for our project also did a great job in executing the entire project. He was very accommodative of all our requests no matter how small they were and delivered the house interiors as expected and on time. I would for sure go back to livspace again in future."
"Recently got my interior work done by Livspace. All along it was a very good experience. Livspace designer Shrino gave very good design with 3d images of each and every room but where they excel is in execution. Rajashekar, Amit and Sameer made sure that designs gets implemented with perfection. Their attention to details was very good. Overall very happy with work done."
Great Experience. Good execution and good quality material. Definitely worth recommending to all. Talented young professionals with good experience and product and service knowledge. End to end solutions. Customer centric approach. Appreciate efforts taken for customer support
"The experience of working with the Livspace team was an amazing one. They delivered a Quality product ON Schedule.

I interacted with Karan and Apeksha from Livspace and both of them were extremely diligent and kept following up which resulted finally in the delivery of a quality product.

Karan would visit at all odd hours to oversee the work. The fact that the work was being done in Devanhalli adds to the dedication he brings to his work. Extremely impressed.

Apeksha was involved in the project from conception and she was finally able to bring my dreams to fruition. Very commendable.

Thank you Karan and Apeksha."
"We saw interior work by Livspace at a friend's place and we loved the finish. We then finalised on Livspace for interiors of our home at Rohan Iksha.

Our designer, Jaison was very patient and clearly understood our requirements. Vishnu, Subramanya and team did a very good job with the execution. Overall, we had a good experience with the Livspace team and we love their work at our new home."
"Very professional and not compromising on quality.. I like the commitment and dedication towards the work by shruti, shanwaz and Suresh. They executed the plan beautifully and impressed me a lot! I will definitely give it to live space again if I buy another house provided same team to execute.. Thanks a lot Live space."
"I have done entire home interior with livspace Mumbai. End product finishing is absolutely same as decided in photographs. Overall experience is good. Whole team of livspace Harsh, Sushant, Dhara and Chandni were very co=operative and excellent in their field and were always available on phone/site whenever needed."
"Excellent work done by Priyanka Bhattad. She helped a lot with all the discussions , serious designs and finalisation with best space utilisation. Outcome of final installed product is great. Thanks Livspace !!! Excellent handling within timeline mentioned."
"Overall we had a satisfactory experience with LivSpace Bangalore in terms of providing recommendation and delivered products within acceptable time frame since last 9-months. From the day-1 we were being supported by Mamata Banthia & Astha Jain(senior designers) w.r.t. furniture design options, color selection related to various cost as well. Sharing 3D design according to my room size and on time site inspection was really helpful and save lot of time from my side. Really appreciate their flexibility in terms of discussion period over the week end, selecting the custom product, sending good pictures/thoughts w.r.t. my room theme keeping in mind. Delivery was happened initially as per my convenient over the week end and slowly they acquired my confidence that, product inspection & delivery used to occur without my presence as well. This helped me a lot in terms of time saving aspect. Reward should goes to Mr. Vishnu Benz(Sr. Manager), all these thing used to happen under his supervision only. Site inspection before delivery, product transfer & fitting and final sign-off was really easy my life. Thanks to the whole team. They even helped me to do some custom work as well. Very well connected, easy to communicate, faster response in case of any critical situation – it is a full package. They are still helping me to beautify my room/apartment. Thanks for their knowledge, hard work and dedication."
"I had nice experience with livspace team. Designer Priyal Shinde is really good in her job. She exactly understands what the customer needs. She explains each and everything so nicely that you feel really comfortable in giving the designing work to livspace. Since this was my first flat, so I was not very well planned with what things to put up in my kitchen and how to go about it. But All thanks to Priyal in making these things very simple for me. I would highly recommend priyal for her work.

Excellent job!!"
"I am really impressed with the way they carried out the modular kitchen project.. And i am very much happy with the design services and the service @site provided by the team.

Designer Praveen Kumar has been impressive with the support, coordination and humbleness extended in freezing the design of our kitchen to the expectation.

Whole process of implementation was carried out smoothly by the team Prathap, Shashi and Nikhil.

I appreciate the coordination and support provided by the team during the successful completion of the project.

Its simply GOOD JOB DONE by Livspace team ??"
"We engaged Livspace for our 2bhk flat designing and we promptly engaged with them and started discussions. It was handled by community Manager Mrs. Ashmita Banerjee and designer Mrs.Mrudhula.

We discussed high level plan and a draft proposal based on that. After making initial booking amount they started preparing the drawings and it took several rounds of meetings, discussions, proposals to arrive at an acceptable solution in last week of Feb.

Much of the interior work in the name of ""Customized work"" will be outsourced to a third-party vendor of their choice which will not be knowing, we thought that they will do the same work with the mentioned price. In the meantime, our main designer left the company without handover the project to other designers.

After I had a discussion with Ashmita Banerjee, she has promised me that the project has to be completed by third week of may as I want to do housewarming function in the month of june 2week, and she has assigned to me Mr. Surender Reddy, Radha Krishna.

They took 3- 5 week of time to manufacture and ship, please note this important detail for later. Nothing happened till 3rd week of may, I sent escalation email to their Hyderabad In charge certain Mr. Lakshminarayan. Later I asked them to complete the installation in 1 week of June.

Shipment came and delived in fistweek of june and started fixing the material by Mr. Murali. But there are some flaws in the drawings and the final presentation which I have got. Fedup with them. and fInally I just adjusted which I have got it.(crockery Unit design is wrong, Wardrobe design is not as we explained)

Mr Mr Murali and team they have fixed material in 3 days. They done a good job for me. He is very Professional, dedicated and passionate to his work

Finally: - Not Satisfied with their process and Plan, Hyderabad operations are sucks. No Proper planning and handling the situations. Only few people are good in the team like Mr Mrali, he done a good job and saved my time."
"The interior work of our 3 bedroom flat at Brigade Panorama, Mysore road was done by Livspace, Bangalore.

The designer has done a very good job by providing a beautiful design as per our requirement and taste.

The executive team consisting of experienced professionals have executed the work very neatly and to our satisfaction. They listened to us at every point and executed the work with patience and completed the work within time. They have taken at most care while doing the jod, with due impo"
"From onboarding, design, validations, execution and handover in expected shape has truly been a memorable journey with Livspace. Interiors is something I will live with all my life and thanks to Livspace for making it beautiful. Design consultant Vijay was very patient in his approach, trying to get our ever-changing expectations aligned to best designs available in Livspace or elsewhere (through vendors). This helped us get the most satisfying design out for execution. Project Managers Shubraneel and Sachin took full charge of execution and I had very minimal concerns during this time. The implementation was well planned, resourcing was perfect, timelines were met with meticulous effort and house with interiors was handed over like a completely new house. Best part of the whole process was the seamless coordination between Livspace, their vendors, our vendors (for painting, AC fitting etc.). The team of Shubraneel, Sachin and Vikas made sure they handled integrations between vendors well. Appreciate all your efforts and will recommend Livspace to everyone I know. Thank you."
"I first heard about livspace from a friend of mine and also a relative who had got their interiors done through livspace. Upon receiving good reviews , I dint think twice to get associated with them to get interiors done for my new apartment, and needless to say they lived up to my expectation in terms of designs, delivery and service.

I was initially contacted by Neha who later introduced me to ever bubbly and charming Niyama. Niyama was very patient with all our asks and after multiple design discussions we came up with a final design which suited our budget, but yet dint compromise on quality or service. Thankful to Niyama for that.

Though our apartment was quite far from the city centre, Niyama and team dint hesitate to make multiple visits to make sure things got completed quickly, smoothly and neatly . During this period, I got to meet another gem from the team - Sachin . Sachin was extremely patient with all my requests and got everything fixed on time. He even took care of hob chimney and gas connections which were not ever part of his service. The final deep cleaning gave a complete new life to a house .

I would like to thank Neha and her whole team for giving their best and definitely recommend to contact livspace for interior designs."
"We just happened to see Livspace ad in Google and soon got ourselves registered. Since then it's been an amazing journey till the end of the project execution. Excellent team . Our project designer Samhita who designed our Kitchen did an excellent job! Thanks to Ms.Samhita, Project manager Mr. Murali, Community head Ms. Swathi who were always there to closely monitor the progress and the installation team with

Mr. Sharif. We are now proud owners of a beautiful and work friendly kitchen. 3 major strengths of Livspace as per our experience:

Time bound- They delivered the project as per their promised timelines.

Team work - Designer, site manager, head and installation team took up the ownership till the execution stage.

Quality: we found the quality of kitchen cabinets and accessories as per specification.

4.skilled technicians."
"Absolutely Fantastic & Satisfactory experience getting the full house furnished by Super talented Designer Rishabh Shah from Livspace, he’s got amazing foresightness and well expert at understanding client’s requirements properly.

Truly professional team while installations and excellent service and support. Highly impressive and truly commendable."
"We had a great experience working with Livspace Bangalore. Waheda Begum was assigned as the designer for our project. She is an experienced professional with good knowledge in interior designing. From Day1, she understood what we are expecting from Livspace. She understands the flat architecture and helped us out in understanding the various aspects of interior designing as well, which gave us confidence to handover the flat to Livspace. To finalize the design, we had gone for multiple round of discussion with Waheda. She understood our requirement and came up with good suggestions. She is very good at her job and you can rely on her experience and knowledge. She visited our flat multiple times to finalize the design. Thanks to Waheda for putting so much of effort.

Mr Ashok was assigned as project manager for this project. He executed the project very well. He is very cordial while talking to customer and always tried to provide good service. As suggested by Ashok we went for small changes in the design and we realized that it was very helpful in our day to day use of the kitchen and wardrobe. Livspace also verifies the project once it is completed. They will check if there are some room for improvement. Ashok was very quick and helpful to incorporate some changes we suggested.

One suggestion for the people who are thinking of going with Livspace for their interior work. Please assign all your interior work to Livspace but not partly. Because we experienced that doing a part of interior work yourself is very cumbersome and tiring. Yes, Livspace is expensive. But quality comes with a price tag. Livspace takes care of your work end to end. You don’t have to run every day and check the progress. Ashok had been sending weekly status report with pictures to update us about the progress.

We are very happy with the work of Waheda and Ashok. They both were very co-operative. We are thanking Livspace again for such a nice execution of the project. You can simply give your flat in the safe hands of Livspace and relax. It was really a great experience working with Livspace."
We did interiors for our flat and the whole experience was great. Our design engineer Ms. Charmi was very creative and knowledge and helped us in finalising a great design. We had lot of options in terms of material and finish to choose with. Their model showroom had different designs and models to give the users a good understanding of the finish.
"My experience with livespace has been wonderful. Ms Dhanlaxmi Nair at Livespace Pune , is a very dedicated and super prompt designer. She understands the requirement to the core and puts in her heart and soul to bring your dream home plan infront of you. Wishing the Livespace team the very best!"
Excellent design and execution with timely delivery ...very good products from livspace..highly recommended for end to end solution for interiors..good coordination of the team with my minimul involvement was the best thing about livspace..awesome job Pune team
"Livspace modelled the kitchen and wardrobes in 3 of our rooms. They have done excellent work, and we have received numerous compliments regarding the work from our friends and relatives. We just hope that in the future they provide more color/laminate options especially in the lower price ranges also. The laminate color options they have is very limited compared to other places. The team including Himani, Kanika, Mallikarjun and Ajay were always reachable and the communication was easy. They were always available for any support required. We are grateful for the flexibity they showed in accomodating to our timing. We appreciate all the work done and recommend the team."
"It was great getting these interiors done through Livspace, Design team was very supportive and they made sure we get good results. They have understood our requirements and thought process well and have adapted the designs as per our needs. We never had to think twice on any solution they have suggested. It was a great experience all through. We are happy with the outcome and their endless enthusiasm, and appreciate all the team work that has given us warm, refreshing holiday home."
"Very bad experience from project start to end, one of my wrong decisions which I made to go head with my project.

Problem is with not on quality of item, but worst quality from people.

They have zero customer orientation.

I had all problems with Livspace during my project execution & now after sales is much worst, some of there work need fine tuning & also in some areas it is leaking, I am waiting from past 30 days to get a response from there team & till today none responded.

So I kindly request don’t go with Livspace they are very good in website & inside there experience room, in reality they are not a worth company to plan.

I have a long list of problems, if any one need details contact me."
"Livespace has done a good job in terms of design and execution. They showed us 3D rendered images before starting the actual site work and after execution, the look was exactly the same. They did the site work very fast. The finishing is good. Overall I am very happy with the look of my new apartment."

"It was really great experience with Livspace. They were always supportive in the design and look for our new 2 BHK home. It took 2 months but was worth every minute spent on the design, color and material of the furniture. Special thanks to Subair and Rajvi to help me and my wife get the best furniture for our house.

Thanks for everything Livspace."
"The start was a very good one, with the designer, Ashfaq and he really knew what we required,

once the site started there were really challenges with the people working on the site on the quality of the work.

at that moment, harsh sheth, was introduced to us, who took full ownership of the site and the timelines that were decided earlier.

he ensured that the site was delivered to us on time without compromising on the quality of work"
"I would like to appreciate Team Livspace for giving us our Dream Home in the budget that we had.

A big shout for and thank you to Amit Nagar & team, our project manager. He handled the work with utmost sincerity and dedication. We can't thank him enough for all this hard work & support. Must say that Amit has excellent project management & execution ideas and solutions. Would really recommend to have him for the project.

We would also like to thanks Nivedita S for giving her excellent skills and experience to our home. Must say that Nivedita is an excellent manager and knows how to solve different situations.

Lastly, but not the least, thanks to our designer Charmi Y, who contributed really fresh ideas and modern designs to our home.

Definitely recommend working with livspace team for projects."
"Super Happy with the LivSpace design, finishes, quality, execution, services and support team:)

I really like their approach towards each and everything, starting from the design discussion to the execution. I have been informed about the process very clearly at the very first call with Kalyani, She helped me to understand the timeline and I have made my plans accordingly.

Our designer Aditi had a very good suggestion for the kitchen. With a small civil change our kitchen is looking pretty big and became more functional. Also, the finishes what she suggested are perfect for our taste.

The execution team of Harsha and Prakash was really professional in their work and maintaining the decorum of the house. They shared the day to day updates with me, also they finish the execution quickly as I had to travel.

I really like the way Livspace do the floor protection and deep cleaning for the house.

They actually care about your house.

Many thanks to kalyani and team for their excellent work and dedication."
"We had a very Pleasant experience with livspace team right from the beginning. Planning to execution of the plan .They were very professional.Our project manager Mr.Kiran and designer Ms.kalpita were approachable and available at all times and executed what we had in our mind perfectly.Thanks to the livspace team for their efforts in making our House a ""Home"""
"We would like to thanks Livspace for working and designing our home with great quality work and good satisfaction level. Though the project had few issues in the middle but all was well-taken care by Livspace which is commendable and thanks to the entire team for taking and designing our dream home.

They are very approachable, helpful and also listens very nicely. Madhuriya, Swathi, Sandeep, Akhil are more of friends now than acquaintances,

Happy customers and will look forward to another project stint with you."
"I draw inspiration from livspace whenever I’m picking up a decor piece or redoing a part of my house.

It is a great platform to go check out new trends and get great services if you want a well designed home that reflects you. The charges are reasonable and will be totally worth what you get."
"Tjhe design team spent good amount of time with our family. They understood our requirements and they gave multiple designs. I appreciate the work done by design team head by Mrs.Monica. She took the project as her own and with much patience she gave us the best suggestions and ultimately provided me the best designs.

The items are delivered on time and execution team delivered the model llike how they appeared in my 3d design.

I can proudly say my kitchen and my interior are one of the best in my community.

I have one feedback to livespace to give wardrobes shutters also plywood along with MDF.

I strongly recommend livespace for your interiors."
